# Cunection - A Web Application to Connect Clubs

---

## Overview
### Purpose
This is a website, called Cunection (pronounced just like "connection"), built originally as a Senior Project in the fall of 2022. It is intended to continue on, hopefully into production.

Cunection is a website for clubs, specifically on the CUNE Campus in Seward, NE. Of course, it is not limited to only that campus. It was built to connect students with clubs and club events, along with giving club admins a platform to reach out to students. We want to increase both club participation and club outreach on campus. 

We hope to pass this project on to the Programming Team at CUNE for further development in the future.
